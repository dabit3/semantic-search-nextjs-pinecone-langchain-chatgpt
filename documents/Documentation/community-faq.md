The Lens ecosystem is growing at speed 🚀

We’ve noticed on Social and our Discord server a few questions around similar topics so wanted to give you all an update on these

## How to get a Lens handle?

We have allocated some profiles to targeted communities over the last few months, and the response and feedback have been amazing so far will continue to work with partners to allowlist some communities. If you see an announcement explaining how to get access from one of these communities ✅ this will be your best option for now

We also participate, support, and host various events around the globe 🌎

⚒️ If you wish to build on Lens at these events our team can help get you a profile on the ground at the event

🤝 If you are visiting our booth or talking with our team, there is usually a POAP close by which can get you access.

## Wen Lens open for all?

We’re still in closed Beta, we are doing this to attain feedback and improve the experience for when we fully open to the masses

We are excited to get you all enjoying Lens, but we want to do it at the right time to give you the best experience possible

If you haven't been able to get access to Lens yet, but would like to learn more about the growing Lens ecosystem, here's an awesome [article](https://medium.com/@fabriguespe/lens-protocol-application-ecosystem-update-october-d8381c635dcc) from our developer relations team 

Head to our [Lensverse](https://lens.xyz/apps) page to discover hundreds of applications built 🛠 on Lens Protocol 

## How much time do I have to claim my profile once eligible?

You will have 30 days to claim your profile once you have been allowlisted off of the waitlist. After that period, you will lose your opportunity to claim your Lens profile.

## What are reserved handles? Why do I get an error saying the handle is reserved?

Certain handles have been reserved for multiple reasons, for example, certain famous brands are limited from claiming to avoid user confusion around the ownership of those handles.

It is possible that certain reserved handles may be coincident with your desired lens profile. We are working on this as our plan is to reduce the amount of reserved Lens handles going forward.  

## How can I transfer a Lens Profile?

Similarly as you would do with any NFT, by sending them into any other wallet or interface that supports Polygon NFTs.

## I represent a project, protocol, community, etc, and I love what you guys are doing. How can I interact with you regarding integrations, partnerships and so?

The best way to be in touch with the community is to be active on Discord, as well as in any Lens protocol interfaces.

However, you can always send any inquiries regarding integrations, partnerships and so on to ecosystem@lens.xyz

## Do you have a Discord?

Sure, the Lens Protocol Discord link can be found [here](https://discord.gg/lensprotocol).

Please take into account that there are some users impersonating admins. Please note, that admins will never DM you first or share any business opportunities, or ask you for favours, your seed phrase, funds, etc.
